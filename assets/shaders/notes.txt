Objective is to render instanced models, loaded from gltf files, both on desktop (lwgl3) and on web (teamvm).



13/9/2023:


The libgdx default shader doesn't work well with gltf models, they render black instead of showing the diffuse texture.
Or at least on web, on desktop it works fine (why?).

Alternative: use fbx models.

To use fbx model:

- In Blender lie the model along the positive Y axis (r x -90) and apply rotations.
- FBX export with scale 100 and Up: Z up to file corn.fbx
- Then from commandline: fbx-conv -f -o gd3dj corn.fbx
