Objective is to render instanced models, loaded from gltf files, both on desktop (lwgl3) and on web (teamvm).


13/9/2023:

Some gltf models appear without texture (in black) in the web version, while they render fine on desktop.

        Perhaps related to this warning: GL_INVALID_OPERATION: Cannot generate mipmaps for a zero-size texture in a WebGL context.
